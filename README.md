# Hi! My name is Denis Skvortsov
I'm a Quality Control Automation Engineer with a strong expertise in using Cypress and JavaScript (TypeScript). In my free time, I'm always learning and writing code to improve my skills and knowledge in these technologies, as well as acquire new ones.

Aside from my professional work, I also spend my free time studying programming with a focus on JavaScript. In this repository, you'll find my personal projects that I've worked on while learning.

I strive to apply best practices in my work, including both end-to-end and integration testing, to ensure that the software I test meets the highest standards of quality. I'm always looking to improve my skills and take on new challenges in the field of quality control automation. 

Thank you for visiting my profile, and I hope you find my work informative and useful.
